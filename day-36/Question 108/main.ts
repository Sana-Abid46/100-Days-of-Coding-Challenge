// Question 108: Compare two strings to check if they are identical, ignoring case sensitivity.

// Explain & TIP: To compare strings without considering their case (uppercase/lowercase), you can convert both strings to the same case before comparing.

let myName = "SANA";

let Name = "sana"


console.log(myName.toLowerCase() === Name.toLowerCase());

// output.... true
