// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

// Original list of magicians
let magicians: string[] = ["Harry Houdini", "David Copperfield", "Penn Jillette", "Teller"];

// Function to modify the array of magicians
function make_great(magicians: string[]): string[] {
    return magicians.map(magician => `the Great ${magician}`);
}

// Function to show the modified list of magicians
function show_magicians(magicians: string[]): void {
    console.log(magicians);
}

// Modify the array of magicians
let great_magicians = make_great(magicians);

// Show the modified list of magicians
show_magicians(great_magicians);
