// Question 109: Write an if statement that logs "Good Morning" if the current time is before 12 PM.

// Explain & TIP: You can get the current hour using the Date object and its getHours() method. Remember, hours are in 24-hour format, so 12 PM is 12.

let time: any = new Date()

let get: any = time.getHours()

if ( get < 12) {

    console.log("Good Morning");
    
};
