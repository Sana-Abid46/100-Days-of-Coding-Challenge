// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

    var carInfo = { model: model, manufacturer: manufacturer };
    if (color) {
        carInfo.color = color;
    }
    if (aditionalInfo) {
        carInfo.aditionalInfo = aditionalInfo;
    }
    return carInfo;
